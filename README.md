Kubernetes is an open source system for managing [containerized applications]
across multiple hosts; providing basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance,
and scaling of applications.

Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience at Google running
production workloads at scale using a system called [Borg],
combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

Kubernetes is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF]).
If you are a company that wants to help shape the evolution of
technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled
and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF.
For details about who's involved and how Kubernetes plays a role,
read the CNCF [announcement].
